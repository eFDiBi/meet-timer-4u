## Manual Installation Guide

This extension is not published in the Chrome Web Store, so it must be installed manually using Chrome's "Developer mode." It is a safe and simple process.

## Steps to Install

### 1. Download and Prepare
Download the .zip file for this extension (or clone the repository).

Unzip the file into a folder on your computer. 

_**Note**: Make sure you know where this folder is; do not delete the files after installation._

### 2. Open the Extension Manager
Open Google Chrome.

In the address bar, type: chrome://extensions/ and press Enter.

Alternatively, go to the three-dot menu (top right) > Extensions > Manage Extensions.

### 3. Activate Developer Mode
In the upper right corner of the extensions page, find the switch that says "Developer mode".

Activate it (the switch should be on the right/blue).

### 4. Load the Extension
You will see three new buttons appear in the upper left. Click on "Load unpacked".

A window will open for browsing files. 

Navigate and select the folder you unzipped in step 1. 

_**Important**: Select the root folder that contains the manifest.json file._

### 5. Ready!
The **"Meet Timer 4u"** extension should now appear in your list.

To use it easily, click on the "puzzle piece" icon 🧩 in the Chrome toolbar and press the pin (📌) next to **"Meet Timer 4u"** to pin it.

## Troubleshooting

**"Invalid Manifest" Error**
Make sure you have selected the correct folder (the one with manifest.json inside) and not a parent or child folder.

**Extension Disappeared**
If you move or delete the folder from your computer, the extension will stop working. Chrome reads the files directly from that location.
