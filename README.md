# Google Meet Timer & Ambience Extension
A lightweight, professional Chrome Extension designed to manage time effectively during Google Meet calls. It adds a draggable, floating countdown timer directly into the meeting interface, complete with customizable visual themes and background music capabilities.

## 🚀 Features

- Floating Widget: A non-intrusive, draggable card that floats over your meeting (approx. 30% screen size). Move it anywhere to keep your presentation visible.
- Visual Urgency: The timer text turns red and pulses when less than 10 seconds remain.
- Custom Ambience:
  - Background: Set a custom image URL for the timer card.
  - Music: Embed a YouTube video URL (audio only) to play background music during the countdown.
- Hot Updates: Update settings (time, music, image) instantly without refreshing the Google Meet tab.
- Clean UI: Shows "TIEMPO CUMPLIDO" (Time's Up) with a close button (X) only when the timer finishes.
- Smart Persistence: Remembers your settings for the next meeting.
